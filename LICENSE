The "We-Swear-It's-Original" License
Copyright (c) 2024 Totally-Not-PearAI

Congratulations, you’ve stumbled upon the most groundbreaking, totally original software of the decade. We poured minutes of effort into ahem carefully adapting it. You’re free to use it, but just keep these guidelines in mind:

Don’t just ctrl+c, ctrl+v like we definitely didn’t do—make it yours! Add some flair, maybe a rainbow theme or at least one emoji. 🌟
If you reuse this, call it something clever. Don’t just slap “AI” onto it and hope for the best. (Pro Tip: “Not-Not-AI” is still available.)
Whenever someone asks, "Did you write this?", just confidently say "Yes-ish."
This software comes with absolutely zero guarantees, much like the originality of some... other projects we won’t name (cough PearAI cough). Use at your own risk—if it breaks, crashes, or gains sentience, that’s all you.

Disclaimer:
This license is dripping with satire. Any resemblance to real companies, particularly fruit-themed ones, is purely coincidental, unless you know who we’re talking about, in which case—yeah, it’s about them. Chill out; it’s a joke.

P.S. To any lawyers out there: relax, have a pear, and Google "parody law."
